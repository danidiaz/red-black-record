# Revision history for red-black-record

## 1.1.0.0

* Field and Branch type families to help speed up type-level computations. 

  Apparently, having identical invocations of a "costly to compute" type family
  in a signature slowed things down.

## 1.0.0.2

* Improved compilation times for getters by refactoring `KeyHelper`.

## 1.0.0.0

* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.
