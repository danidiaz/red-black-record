- Clarify the need for "KeysAllF"

- Turn KeysAll into something like KeysValuesAll that takes a two-place constraint.
    - Reimplement KeysAll in terms of KeysValuesAll (possible?)
    - It might be useful for expressing things like "All the key-value pairs in
      this record are present in this other record".

- Interaction with normal records
    - NominalRecord, NominalSum?
